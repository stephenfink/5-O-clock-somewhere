5 O' Clock Somewhere is our app to help those who are staying at home and want to make their favorite drinks from the bar and cook delicious food. 
It gives a image, ingredients, and measurements, and instructions on how to make the item.

This can be use to make a drink just for you, or become the best host amoung your friends.


## APIs and Third Party Documentation
The First Api is the drinks which is the first function of the app, this let users pick what type of Alcohol they want as their base.

## Future ideas

The first idea we want to add is a rating system for pairing foods with drinks to see the best combinations people make. Then the user is able to save their pairing with a login function and to link it to social media.

The other future idea was to add games to the app, so when a user logs in they and anyone else who has the app can play with others with a few clicks.

Lastly, but not least, we wanted to add more Vegan choices and reviews.
